# Sushi Restaurant Template

The goal of this project was to create a functional, easy to use website aiming at improving our understanding of the web development process. Following our love for asian cuisine we settled on creating a website for a fictional restaurant called ‘PogFish Asian’. 

The website implements a modular design making it quick and easy to add or remove items from the menu through the use of a database. A signup and login system was also implemented. This gives the user the ability to save their favourite dishes to their account as well as receive by email a list of all their favourite dishes whenever they please.

The website was developed using the xampp software to host the website and subsequent database.
